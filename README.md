# Sass-rhythm

Sass-rhythm is a [Sass](https://github.com/nex3/sass) based tool that simplifies composing a vertical rhythm.

### Requirements

Sass 3.2.0+

## Installation

### Bower:

- Terminal: `bower install sass-rhythm`
- SCSS: `@import 'path/to/bower_components/sass-rhythm/rhythm';`

### Vanilla Sass

- Copy `_rhythm.scss` into your project
- SCSS: `@import 'path/to/rhythm';`

## Getting started

1. Set a base typography:

   ```scss
   html {
     @include rhythm-init(18px, 1.5, 'golden section');
   }
   ```

2. Change a `font-size` and adjust a `line-height`:

   ```scss
   // increases paragraph's font-size by 2 levels regarding to the chosen scale
   // and automatically adjusts its line-height
   p {
      @include rhythm-text(2);
   }
   ```

3. Change border-widths, margins, heights etc. in respect of the previously initialized typography:

   ```scss
   // sets a "padding-left" property to "5 * current line-height"
   padding-left: rhythm(5);
   // or
   padding-left: 5 * $rhythm;

   ```

## Reference

### Variables

- `$rhythm` - returns the base line-height's value in pixels.

### Functions

#### rhythm

Returns the base line-height's value in pixels multiplied by *n*.

```
rhythm([n])
```

- `n`
  - **type** - number (unitless)
  - **default value** - *1*

### Mixins

#### rhythm-init

Should be included once, most optimally in the `html` selector.

```
rhythm-init(font-size, line-height, modular-scale);
```
- `font-size`
  - **type** - number (px)
  - **description** - base font-size
- `line-height`
  - **type** - number (unitless)
  - **description** - base line-height
- `modular-scale`
  - **type** - number (unitless) or string (see *Predefined scale names*)
  - **description** - modular-scale which font-size and line-height will be based on

#### rhythm-text

Increases (or decreases) selector's font-size regarding to the chosen scale and automatically adjusts line-height.

Can be used within any selector.

```
rhythm-text(font-size[, line-height])
```

- `font-size`
  - **type** - number (unitless)
  - **description** - indicates how very enlarged or shrunk the text should be
- `line-height`
  - **type** - string (*tight* or *loose*)
  - **default value** - *loose*
  - **description** - sometimes text with *tight* line-height looks better (e.g. headings with large font-size above regular paragraphs)
